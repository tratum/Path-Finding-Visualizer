          - Every square is a node.

          - Every node is connected to the four nodes on its north,
            east, south and west direction.

          - Initial number on the node is randomly generated and 
            represents the difficulty in reaching that node from 
            its surrounding nodes.

          - Final number updated on the node is the cost of reaching 
            that node from the starting point.

          - Initial cost to every node except the First node is infinity.

          1. Starting with the chosen node, update the cost of reachable
             nodes by taking minimum of
             [ 
             (cost to reach the "coming from" node + difficulty to the 
             visiting node) previously updated cost to the visiting node
             ] 
             set the "coming from" node as parent if the cost is less 
             to come from that node. 

          2. Repeat the steps for reachable nodes in the sequence of
             least cost to most cost, until all nodes have been visited.
